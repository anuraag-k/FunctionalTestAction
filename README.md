## HCL OneTest UI GitHub Action
HCL OneTest provides software testing tools to support a DevOps approach: API testing, functional testing, UI testing, performance testing and service virtualization. It helps you automate and run tests earlier and more frequently to discover errors sooner - when they are less costly to fix.

This action enables the ability to run tests and compount tests from HCL OneTest UI projects on self hosted runners.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Configure a self hosted runner on a suitable machine
1. The host machine will need a licensed copy of HCL OneTest UI and the UI projects containing the tests you wish to run.
2. [Add a self-hosted runner](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners) at an appropriate level, ensure you have configured network access.
3. If you are using more than one runner [assign it a suitable label](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/using-labels-with-self-hosted-runners) and note this for later.

### Setup
In the repository you want to apply the action to
1. Create a folder named ".github/workflows" in the root.
2. Create a .yml file with any name, inside the ".github/workflows" folder based on the following example content:

```yaml
name: HCL OneTest UI

on: workflow_dispatch

jobs:
    UI-Action:
        runs-on: self-hosted
        name: HCL OneTest UI
        steps:
         - name: Execute Test
           uses: HCL-TECH-SOFTWARE/onetest-ui-action@main
           with:
            projectDirectory:  <C:\Data\MyProject>
            scriptName: <MyScript>
```

3. Update the parameterized items to refer to your project and tests (see parameter details below).
4. If you have more than one runner configured, then use its label as the argument for **runs-on**.
5. Push your updated yml file to the repository.
6. Go to the Actions section in the repository and select the workflow.
7. Click the Run workflow dropdown and the list of input boxes get displayed.

As an alternative to having all of the test projects pre-configured on the runner machine, users could leverage other actions within the workflow to pull down the latest copies. 

### Required Parameters

- **projectDirectory** Fully qualified path to the HCL OneTest UI project directory.
- **scriptName** Name of the script to be executed without the extension. For eg., Script1 or TestFolder.Script1 in case Script1 is in a folder named TestFolder.

### Optional Parameters
- **iterationCount** Number of dataset iterations to be run.
- **logFormat** Format of script execution logs. Choose from Default, none, json, xml, html, text, and TPTP.
- **userArguments** Additional playback arguments, if any. If there are multiple arguments, you must enclose each argument within double quotes and separate the arguments by providing a space between them.

## Troubleshooting
- **No runner available:** Check that the runner still exists in GitHub, if the local agent has not connected to GitHub for a period of 14 days then it will be automatically removed.
